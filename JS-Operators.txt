
Question No.1: Ternary Operator for Even or Odd Check
Explanation:
The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements in a single line. Its syntax is:
javascript
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;

Here, if the condition is true, the first expression is executed; otherwise, the second expression is executed.
Program:
javascript
// Program to check whether a number is even or odd using the ternary operator
let number = 7;
let result = number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
console.log(`${number} is ${result}.`);



Question No.2: Comma Operator in JavaScript
Explanation:
The comma operator evaluates multiple expressions and returns the result of the last expression. It is often used to combine multiple expressions into a single line.
Example:
javascript
// Example demonstrating the usage of the comma operator
let a = 2, b = 3, sum;
sum = (a++, b++, a + b);
console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`); // Output: Sum: 7



Question No.3: Nested Ternary Operator for Positive, Negative, or Zero Check
Program:
javascript
// Program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero using nested ternary operators
let num = -5;
let result = num > 0 ? "Positive" : (num < 0 ? "Negative" : "Zero");
console.log(`${num} is ${result}.`);



Question No.4: Ternary Operator for Voting Eligibility Check
Program:
javascript
// Program to check if a person is eligible to vote using the ternary operator
let age = 20;
let eligibility = age < 18 ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";
console.log(eligibility);
These solutions cover the usage of the ternary operator, nested ternary operators, and the comma operator in JavaScript.
